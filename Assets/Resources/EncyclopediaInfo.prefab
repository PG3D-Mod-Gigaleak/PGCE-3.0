  entries:
  - name: Zombie_Skeleton
    description: Assumed to be second of its species, this is, as stated before,
      the second instance of the "living undead". Though it resembles a skeleton,
      it's not as weak as one would be, being similar in strength and speed to the
      Zombie.
    strategy: 
  - name: Crawler_Default
    description: Being essentially a downgrade of the Zombie, its weakness is not
      being as frightening as the others. Of course, this doesn't make it any less
      difficult to handle as an enemy, functioning essentially the same as the Zombie.
    strategy: 
  - name: Slime_Default
    description: Unlike most of the others, this isn't a "living undead". The true
      origin of it is unknown, yet it's speculated that it originates from a completely
      different universe than ours.
    strategy: 
  - name: Ghost_Default
    description: This isn't actually a ghost, despite what it looks like and what
      its widespread name is. Nobody is sure about where this entity came from, and
      no information can be extrapolated from the being as it is incapable of any
      form of communication.
    strategy: 
  - name: Lanky_Spider_Default
    description: You're welcome tibzzz. I added the spider tibzzz. Are you happy?
      This game is a result of tibzzz asking me to do stuff over and over. He wanted
      me to decompile 3.11, so I did. He wanted me to add spiders, so I did. Now
      I gotta add headshots.
    strategy: 
  - name: Mini_Zombie
    description: He was expecting Joe Blo, but instead he got PixlMan. Needless to
      say this zombie is very confused.
    strategy: 
  - name: Mini_Zombie_Elite
    description: PixlMan wasn't ready for this kind of zombie. That's more Joe Blo's
      area of expertise. Hey, I wonder where Joe Blo is..
    strategy: 
  - name: Zombie_Mummy
    description: Despite it being a mummy, meaning the first instance of it probably
      derived from way back in the past, it was actually first spotted way after
      the normal Zombie and Zombie Skeleton. It's incredibly aggressive and it will
      not give up on a target unless someone else angers it during combat.
    strategy: 
  - name: Egyptian_Crawler
    description: Check the Crawler's description instead.
    strategy: 
  - name: Skeleton_Head
    description: Similar to the Zombie Head, this one is tied to the Zombie Skeleton.
    strategy: 
  - name: Raven_Mummy
    description: Check the Raven's description instead.
    strategy: 
  - name: Egyptian_Stalker
    description: Check the Stalker's description instead.
    strategy: 
  - name: Spider_Default
    description: Also known as a "zombified spider", this isn't truly a spider despite
      its looks. Being bigger and less weak compared to normal spiders, it's assumed
      that this was simply an evolution of a normal spider after being "zombified".
    strategy: 
  - name: Army_Crawler
    description: Check the Crawler's description instead.
    strategy: 
  - name: Zombie_Default
    description: Even with the insane amount of them existing in this world, they
      are also very unique, being what's assumed to be the first instance of living
      beings apart from humans. They are very slow and weak, though, and cause almost
      no damage even in big packs.
    strategy: 
  - name: Raven_Default
    description: One of the first instances of "zombified" beings that are capable
      of flying. Their flying is very limited though, and it doesn't help them get
      anywhere higher up compared to the others. Due to their flight capabilities,
      they are way faster than the basic Zombie.
    strategy: 
  - name: Zombie_Mutant_Default
    description: Slow yet resistant, this zombie is way stronger than the basic Zombie,
      and it's capable of causing a lot of damage if you stand still near one. One
      downside, or upside if you're a human, is that they're incredibly slow with
      their attacks, and it is very easy to escape from them if you're not packed
      into one place by other enemies.
    strategy: 
  - name: Stalker_Default
    description: Though it doesn't have any eyes, it's capable of perfectly spotting
      you no matter what. Unfortunately for it, though, it isn't as strong as most
      of the others.
    strategy: 
  - name: Zombie_Head_Default
    description: This is what's left of the Zombie when it loses its head. Surprisingly,
      the head is perfectly sentient and functions as a completely different being
      once detached from its host. Only capable of jumping around and biting humans,
      it's not very strong.
    strategy: 
  - name: Headless_Zombie_Default
    description: It doesn't have its head, yet it can still function perfectly fine
      and can still spot humans just as well as when it has one. This entity is,
      in every way, just a decapitated Zombie, and between it and the Zombie, there
      aren't any huge or noticeable differences.
    strategy: 
  - name: Zombie_Patient
    description: Well he had terminal lung cancer anyways. He's disappointed he couldn't
      get his drug money to his family though.
    strategy: 
  - name: Zombie_Crawler
    description: There's only one thing worse than being a normal boring zombie.
    strategy: 
  - name: Zombie_Surgeon
    description: He spent his whole life working towards being a surgeon. After finishing
      college and finally paying off his debt, he was killed on his first day.
    strategy: 
  - name: Red_Slime
    description: You'd think he'd be made of blood, but no. He's actually made of
      red jello
    strategy: 
  - name: Stalker_Mutant_Default
    description: The dragon finally realized that getting rid of their arms wasn't
      useful.
    strategy: 
  - name: Zombie_Prisoner
    description: After being locked up for 15 years on the account of fishing without
      a license, he died on the day he was about to leave
    strategy: 
  - name: Prisoner_Crawler
    description: Once he turned, somebody tried to kill him by putting his head in
      a microwave and breaking his legs. It didn't work.
    strategy: 
  - name: Zombie_Police_Officer
    description: Wait, what is he doing in the prison? Shouldn't he be flying around
      in Sky Island?
    strategy: 
  - name: Mutant_Police_Officer
    description: You've seen Good-cop And Bad-cop, now get ready for Disproportionate-cop
      And Just-A-Head-Cop
    strategy: 
  - name: Red_Spider
    description: A zombie got bored and started painting the spiders. They didn't
      care because it made them look more menacing
    strategy: 
  - name: Enderman
    description: The real endermen were all killed when steve joined in creative
      mode and flooded the end. This is the best the dragon could do
    strategy: 
  - name: Enderman_Crawler
    description: He tripped off one of the pillars. What a loser!

    strategy: 
  - name: Obsidian_Monster
    description: I think the dragon should stay off the cocaine for a while.
    strategy:

    description: I liked the part where he said "It's trolling time!" and then trolled
      all over the place.
    strategy: 
  - name: Small_Troll
    description: Being vastly inferior to his bigger counterpart, he gets bullied
      daily. What a loser!
    strategy: 
  - name: Zombie_Pigman

      to forget him. They removed him too. But I wont stand for this.

    description: He was about to run tests on the aliens when a bunch of zombies
      broke in. The fact nobody was guarding the place is beyond me.
    strategy: 
  - name: Scientist_Crawler
    description: '"Don''t eat me! I''m with the science team!"'
    strategy: 
  - name: Alien_Default
    description: Being taken here against their will, they decided to help the dragon
      in killing all human life. Well at least they had a better reason then "Oh
      no some 15 year old hit me with a shovel :("
    strategy: 
  - name: Zombie_Bear
    description: Hmm, something tells me this isn't a real bear... I wonder what
      it is
    strategy: 
  - name: Yellow_Slime
    description: No, it's not a coincidence the bathrooms were wide open. No I will
      not elaborate
    strategy: 
  - name: Slender
    description: He was ripped off by the endermen. As far as he's concerned they
      deserved what they got.
    strategy: 
  - name: Mutant_Slender
    description: He thought slenderman looked pretty cool, so he met the guy who
      painted those spiders and worked on his slenderman impression
    strategy:

      him happier.

      so the spider just poured some lava on himself
